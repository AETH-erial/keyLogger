# keyLogger
Keylogger built in Python 3.9

dependecies are os, and keyboard

pretty simply/self explanatory program/script. Defined a couple of functions in 'func.py' that act as methods to use
to write keyboard input to a textfile that is stored in temp, and the workingDir method that specifies where the output
method targets.
